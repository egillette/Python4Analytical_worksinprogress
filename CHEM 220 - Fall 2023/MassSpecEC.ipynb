    "# Mass Spectrum Extra Credit Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "You may earn up to 5 points extra credit on your lowest quiz score if you hand in this completed notebook by 11:59 pm December 15th. To complete the assignment, follow the steps here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a molecule with a molar mass greater than 75 g/mol, which contains at least carbon and one other heteroatom which appears in our mass spec handout (O, S, Cl, Br, etc.)\n",
    "2. Find your molecule in the NIST Webbook (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/name-ser/) Note that you can search by name, chemical formula, by CAS number, or in some cases by structure. Be sure that your molecule has a mass spectrum available. \n",
    "3. Download spectrum in JCAMP-DX format. (Note this option will always appear below the image of the mass spectrum for any given compound)\n",
    "4. Upload that file into Google Colaboratory, and use the code below to generate a mass spectrum, and retrieve the table of m/z and relative intensity data\n",
    "5. Use the relative intensity data to answer the questions at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the notebook is complete, update the file name to include your first and last name, and email the complete .ipynb file AS WELL AS THE JCAMPX data file to Dr. Gillette (egillette@sandiego.edu)\n"
