We know what it should be, based on the procedure when it was made, but it is several years old now, and issues of degradation, solvent evaporation, etc. are impossible for us to quantify. In this situation, we will turn to something we consider to be a more reliable (accurate and precise) measurement to provide a comparison measurement that we can use to assess accuracy. For us, that technique is the autotitration using a glass pH probe. So, to assess the accuracy of our results, we need to import that titration data and calculate the concentration of HCl based on that technique. Follow the instructions below to complete that process."
